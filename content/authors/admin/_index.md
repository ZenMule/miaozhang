I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich (PI: Eleanor Chodroff). I am currently working on a project that utilizes a cross-linguistic large scale phonetic corpus ([VoxCommunis Corpus](https://osf.io/t957v/)) to examine phonetic universals and variabilities. My research interests also covers the production of vowel sequence, tone, consonant laryngeal contrast, and their interaction with linguistic prosody. In general, I consider my research approach is that of Laboratory Phonology. I received my Ph.D. degree in Linguistics from the University at Buffalo, SUNY.
