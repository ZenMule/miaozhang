# Short bio
bio: I hold a doctoral degree in Phonetics and presently serve as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Zurich. My research endeavors are dedicated to the in-depth examination of the interfaces between phonetics and phonology, as well as the intricate relationships within the domain of phonetics-prosody.

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher associated with the University of Zurich under the supervision of Dr. [Eleanor Chodroff](https://www.eleanorchodroff.com/). My ongoing scholarly endeavors are centered on the systematic exploration of phonetic universals and variability through the application of a cross-linguistic large-scale phonetic corpus, specifically the [VoxCommunis Corpus](https://osf.io/t957v/). Adopting the tenets of Laboratory Phonology as my theoretical framework, my research spans a diverse array of topics, encompassing the intricate dynamics of vowel sequences, tone, consonant laryngeal contrast, and their nuanced interactions with linguistic prosody.

I hold a Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University at Buffalo, SUNY. My doctoral dissertation delved into the effect of linguistic prosody on the production of vowel sequences in Mandarin Chinese, English, and Japanese.
