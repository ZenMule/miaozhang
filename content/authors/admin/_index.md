I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich (PI: Eleanor Chodroff). My research interests include the production of vowel sequence, tone, consonant laryngeal contrast, and their interaction with linguistic prosody. My main focus of research is to explore the phonology-phonetics interface and the prosody-phonetics interface. My research approach is that of Laboratory Phonology. I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University at Buffalo, SUNY.
