abstract: "This study aims to provide a thorough phonetic analysis of how contrastive tones and stress interact when they coexist in a Sinitic language, Changsha Xiang. The interaction of tone and stress in Sinitic languages is usually overlooked under the term, tone sandhi. This study takes a new phonetic approach to study tonal production in Changsha Xiang without the assumption of tone sandhi. Instead, I argue that the tonal phenomena reported in Changsha Xiang result from the interaction of stress and tone. Two experiments were conducted to investigate disyllabic words with initial and final stress. The F0 contour and duration analyses showed that the variability in tonal production could be grasped by the interaction of lexical tones and three different levels of stress: primary stress, secondary stress, and no stress. The so-called word-initial unstressed syllables are more likely to be secondarily stressed than ``unstressed'' syllables, as suggested in the literature. The six tones retained their underlying targets in both the primary-stressed and secondary-stressed syllables. In the word-final unstressed syllables, the tones merged into four level tones. The results suggest that considering tonal phenomena relative to their metrical structure in Sinitic languages is necessary."
