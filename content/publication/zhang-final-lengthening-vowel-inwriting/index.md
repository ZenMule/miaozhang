abstract: "This study concerns the phrase-final lengthening effect on vowel sequences (e.g., diphthongs) in Chinese, English, and Japanese. Although final lengthening simplex vowels have been thoroughly studied across languages, how vowel sequences are lengthened by prosodic boundaries at the end of a phrase. Recordings of simplex vowels and vowel sequences were taken from the three languages. Three different prosodic contexts are examined: word-final, list-final, and intonational phrase-final positions. Both duration and ratio of lengthening were analyzed. The results show that both simplex vowels and vowel sequences are lengthened occurring at the end of a prosodic phrase. The duration of the vowels are longest in the list-final positions while shortest in the word-final positions. Duration-wise, vowels in English were lengthened the most while those in Chinese were lengthened the least. Lengthening ratio-wise, Japanese vowels were lengthened the most. It was also confirmed that in both English and Japanese, vowel sequences were more lengthened by the prosodic boundaries than monophthongs while the difference is not significant in Chinese. Overall, the research showed that phrase-final lengthening exhibit universal tendency and is also constrained by language-specific factors."
