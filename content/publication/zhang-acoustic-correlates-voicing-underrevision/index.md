abstract: "This study aims to investigate how consonant voicing interacts with other linguistic structural elements to affect the acoustics of speech sounds in Kansai Japanese. Linguistic structures that were explored in this study include vowel height, word accent type, and focus structure. Four acoustic measurements were analyzed: VOT, vowel duration, F0, and F1. The results demonstrated that the voiced bilabial stop /b/ had a long VOT lead, lower F0 values throughout the syllable, longer vowel duration, and lower F1 values than voiceless stop /p/. The analysis further revealed that the VOT was longer when the nucleus is a high vowel (/i/) occurring in the low pitch context (LH) while the vowel duration was shorter in the same context, exhibiting an inverse relation between VOT and vowel duration. The voicing effect on the vowel F0 was not only significant but also interacts with the pitch context. Focus structure, on the contrary did not show much effect in the four measurements. Overall, this study confirmed that Kansai Japanese is a ``true voicing'' language and the voiceless stops have a rather significant raising effect on the F0 throughout the following vowels."
