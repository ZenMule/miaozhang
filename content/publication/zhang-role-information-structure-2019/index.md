abstract: "The results of an Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) experiment conducted in PhonLab at University at Buffalo revealed that both information structure and post-lexical foot structure can lead to supralaryngeal modifications in the production of unstressed syllables. The two effects did not interact with each other, namely, the effects of information structure and post-lexical foot structure are independent. The effects also varied across individual speakers and articulators."
